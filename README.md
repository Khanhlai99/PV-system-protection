Hi, I am Khanh.
This serves as my thesis project related to solar energy. The goal is to use different methods of fault detection and elimination
to protec the whole solar system consisting of PV panels, DC-DC boost converter, and loads.

The Tiva C series TM4C1294 development kit, a product of Texas Instrument, is used to implemented the program.
The code is written in C languange instead of embbedded languange thanks to TIVAWARE library.
